# dead pool

[![deprecated](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/deprecated.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

not maintaining jasba anymore.

it was fun. 

but i use gulp, browserify, make and shell scripts.

must focus on real work, not obsess with having perfect tooling. :-)
